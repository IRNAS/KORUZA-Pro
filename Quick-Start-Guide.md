![Cable opening](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/cable-opening.png?raw=true "Cable opening")

**Step 1:** Connect the WiFi USB to KORUZA Pro unit - to USB port (1).

**Step 2:** Connect the SFP module to KORUZA unit - to SFP port data (2).

Now, KORUZA Pro unit is ready for the installation.

### Unit Installation

KORUZA Pro unit can be mounted in several ways. Here, we show the three common options:
- vertical pole
- horizontal pole
- wall

The preferred pole diameter is 40 mm but the bracket has been designed to fit any standard pole with a diameter between 30 mm and 50 mm. The pole used should ideally be a short pole, not longer than 500 mm, unless firmly mounted on both ends and securely bolted to a fixed structure to avoid unstable operation also under high winds and other bad weather conditions. If in doubt about your installation location, please get in contact with [support@koruza.net](support@koruza.net).

#### Mount up on a vertical pole

**Step 1:** Insert the U-Bolt into the pole clamp and dish bracket.

**Step 2:** Secure each end of the U-Bolt with a washer and a nut.

**Step 3:** Tighten until the spring washer is well compressed.

![Vertical Mount](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/vertical-mount.png?raw=true "Vertical Mount")

or

#### Mount up on a horizontal pole

**Step 1:** Remove the jaws.

**Step 2:** Install the jaws vertically. (Rotate the jaws for 90 degrees.)

**Step 3:** Insert the U-Bolt into the pole clamp and dish bracket.

**Step 4:** Secure each end of the U-Bolt with a washer and a nut.

**Step 5:** Tighten until the spring washer is well compressed.

![Step 4 Horizontal Mount](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/horizontal-mount.png?raw=true horizontal-mount.png "Step 2 Horizontal Mount")

or

#### Mount up on a wall

**Step 1:** Remove the jaws from the mounting bracket.

![Step 1 Wall Mount](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/mounting-bracket.png?raw=true "Mounting Bracket")

**Step 2:** Attach to the wall using screws and wall plugs. You will need 4 screws 13 mm and 4 wall plugs 13 mm.

![Step 2 Wall Mount](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/wall-mount.png?raw=true "Wall mount")

**Step 4:** Put KORUZA Pro on the mounting pole with the unit's opening facing you.

**Step 5:** Connect management and power cable (1).

**Step 6:** Connect data cable /fiber to SFP modul (2).

**Step 7:** Insert cables in the gasket.

![Step 5 & 6  & 7](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/koruza-cables.png?raw=true "Step 5 & 6 & 7")

**Step 8:** Confirm that the unit is turned on by checking that LEDs (at MGMT and data port) inside the unit are on.

**Step 9:** Close the lid.

![Step 8](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/close-the-lid.png?raw=true "Step 8")

**Step 10:** Connect your computer or smartphone to KORUZA network. The default password is koruzakoruza.

**Step 11:** Visit 172.22.0.1. Login information – username: root, password: raspberry.

**Step 12:** Watch the webcam image and point Koruza towards the other unit so you are within cca 1 m. You need to see KORUZA on the screen.

![Step 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/master/img/mgmt-interface.png "Step 12")

**Step 13:** Take a note of the IP address of the unit from the web interface. You will need it later.

**Step 14:** Tighten the two screws at the back of the mounting.

**Step 15:** Tighten the upper screw.

![Step 14 & 15](https://github.com/IRNAS/KORUZA-Pro/blob/master/img/tighten-screws.png?raw=true "Step 14 & 15")

Repeat the same process on the other unit.

### Units Alignment and Link Establishment

**Step 1:** Connect to your management interface so you can access both units. You need to know the IP of your both units. (You made a note of it in the Step 13 of the previous section of the installation process.)

**Step 2:** Use the arrow keys to align the KORUZA units. Aim the center of the red square to the center of the unit to establish the link.

**Step 3:** Link is established when the RX Power is greater than – 25 dBm.


**Step 4:** Now, use the arrow keys to achieve the maximum receive power on the units. For 50 m link distance this is approximately - 3 dBm, for 100 m approximately - 6 dBm and for 150 m approximately -8 dBm.

(**Note:** This step will be replaced by auto alignment functionality - a feature available soon.)

### After installation check list

1. Check that all the mounted parts are tight (poles, screws, nuts ...).
2. Check all cabling is protected from strong winds, retighten or tighten additionally if necessary.
3. Check all connector and other sealments are tight.
4. Check alignment.
5. Check signal strength on both ends.
6. Check all visible parts for any possible damages that may have occurred during installation.

## Software - KORUZA Pro Controller Interface

Documentation on Koruza Pro Controller Interface will be available soon.

## Troubleshooting

Here you can expect Troubleshooting flowcharts to help you troubleshoot in case of failures caused by system, attached network components or environment.

## Maintainance

General maintenance of KORUZA Pro units is minimal, and is somewhat dependent upon the environment under which the units operate. For dustier environments such as cities and industrial sites it is important to keep the front lenses clean, as a dirty front can compromise the performance of the link. Check the units annually or upon significant signal degradation.

The front lenses of KORUZA Pro should be wiped with a clean, damp lint-free cloth at periodic intervals. For clean environments performing this once a year should be sufficient, but were dust or sea salt deposits are likely this should be performed more frequently.

The KORUZA monitoring platform will give you automatic updates on link performance and will notify you in case KORUZA units require your attention.

Do not attempt to open the housing yourself, as there are no user-serviceable parts inside. In case you need assistance, contact [support@koruza.net](support@koruza.net) for support.
